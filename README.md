# Description

I previously implemented [Mastermind in React](https://github.com/taylorjg/Mastermind).
However, the UI is very poor. I decided to try to improve it by using SVG.
I created this separate repo to play around with it.

# TODO

## UI things

* [ ] Add "New Game" button
* [ ] Add "Enter" button to enter a guess
* [ ] Show/hide secret panel cover
    * [ ] Animate it
* [ ] Show a ring of colours when clicking an active large peg hole
* [ ] Add a flashing focus circle to the large peg holes for the active row
* [ ] Allow selection of a colour from the ring

## Non-UI things

* [ ] Add basic game logic

## Boring things

* [ ] Add CI/CD via CircleCI 2.0
* [ ] Deploy to Heroku
