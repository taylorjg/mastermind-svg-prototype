# Description

I previously implemented [Mastermind in React](https://github.com/taylorjg/Mastermind).
However, the UI is very poor. I decided to try to improve it by using SVG.
I created this separate repo to play around with it.

# TODO

## UI things

* [x] Add HTML "New Game" button
* [x] Add HTML "Enter" button to enter a guess
* [x] Show/hide secret panel cover
    * [ ] Animate it
* [ ] Show a ring of colours when clicking an active large peg hole
* [ ] Allow selection of a colour from the ring
* [ ] Add a flashing focus circle to the large peg holes for the active row
* [ ] Use SVG buttons instead of HTML buttons
* [ ] Add some fanfare around game win/loss

## Non-UI things

* [x] Add basic game logic
* [ ] Use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (my first Vue.js app!)

## Boring things

* [ ] Add CI/CD via CircleCI 2.0
* [ ] Deploy to Heroku
